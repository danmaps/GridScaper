### Issue 1: feat: Safety clearance rule engine (client-side)

**Description:** Add a lightweight, client-side rule engine to evaluate clearances between conductors/poles and nearby objects in the scene.

**Implementation Notes & Code References:**
- Scene graph and span structure: [js/main.js#L535-L657](https://github.com/danmaps/GridScaper/blob/main/js/main.js#L535-L657)
- Span rendering: `function drawSpan(a, b) {...}`.
- See `GridScaper_Contexts_and_Equipment.md` for environment/setting references.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/rules/clearances.json` by voltage class,
- `utils/ruleEngine.ts`,
- Integration and unit tests,
- Core rule combinations.

**Milestone:** AI Clearance Coach.
