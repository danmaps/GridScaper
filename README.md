# GridScaper

GridScaper is a 3D simulation tool for visualizing and interacting with power grid infrastructure in various environmental contexts. It allows users to place and modify power poles, observe line sag under different tension settings, and customize terrain, environmental conditions, and equipment types. The application provides a visual interface for understanding how different factors affect power line placement and design.

## Features

- **Interactive Pole Placement**: Add and delete power poles with adjustable heights on the terrain. Poles can be dragged to new positions, and their height can be adjusted after placement.
- **Terrain Customization**: Select from different terrain types:
  - Flat
  - Rolling Hills
  - Hills + Trees (adds generic trees to the rolling hills terrain)
  - The terrain automatically adjusts to pole elevations when URL parameters are used.
- **Adjustable Line Tension**: Modify the tension of the power lines and observe the corresponding sag between poles.
- **Multiple Contexts & Environments**: Simulate various settings which influence building styles, density, and environmental elements:
  - **Settings (Contexts)**: Residential, Commercial, Urban, Rural
  - **Environments**: Coastal, Mountain, Desert, City
- **Diverse Equipment Types**: Represent different parts of the power grid, primarily affecting the appearance (color) of poles and crossarms:
  - Distribution
  - Sub Transmission
  - Bulk Transmission
  - Generation
- **Dynamic Scene Elements**: The application dynamically adds environmental elements based on selected settings:
  - **Buildings**: Type, density, and color of buildings change based on the selected "Setting" and "Environment".
  - **Vegetation**: Trees (generic, palm, pine, urban-style) are added depending on the "Environment" and "Terrain" settings. Cacti and tumbleweeds appear in the Desert environment.
  - **Water Features**: A coastal water body with animated waves and foam is added in the "Coastal" environment.
  - **Roads/Paths**: Basic roads or paths are added in certain environments.
  - **Birds**: Animated birds can appear and perch on power lines.
- **URL Parameterization**: Launch the simulation with predefined configurations for grid dimensions and pole setups.
- **Data Export**: Download the current scene configuration (poles, spans, terrain, tension) as a JSON file.
- **Visual Grid Overlay**: Toggle a visual grid on the terrain with coordinate labels that follow the terrain's contour.
- **Crossarm Orientation**: Crossarms on poles automatically orient themselves based on the direction of the connected power lines.

## How to Use

### Basic Interaction

- **Add Pole**: Left-click on the terrain.
- **Delete Pole**: Right-click on a pole.
- **Adjust New Pole Height**: Use the "New pole height" slider.
- **Select Terrain Type**: Use the "Terrain" dropdown menu.
- **Adjust Line Tension**: Use the "Tension" slider.
- **Toggle Grid Visibility**: Use the "Grid" checkbox.
- **Change Setting**: Use the "Setting" dropdown (Residential, Commercial, Urban, Rural). This primarily affects building generation.
- **Change Environment**: Use the "Environment" dropdown (Coastal, Mountain, Desert, City). This affects terrain color, vegetation, and other environmental props.
- **Change Equipment Type**: Use the "Equipment" dropdown (Distribution, Sub Transmission, Bulk Transmission, Generation). This changes the color of poles and crossarms.
- **Download Scene Data**: Click the "Download" button.
- **Clear Scene**: Click the "Clear Scene" button to remove all poles and spans.
- **Navigate**: Use orbit controls (typically left-click and drag to orbit, mouse wheel to zoom, right-click and drag to pan).
- **Drag Pole Position**: Click and drag an existing pole to move it along the terrain.
- **Adjust Existing Pole Height**: Alt-click (Option-click on Mac) and drag an existing pole up or down.

### Using URL Parameters

GridScaper supports URL parameters to customize the simulation upon loading. Parameters are added to the index.html URL after a `?`, with multiple parameters separated by an `&`.

**Available Parameters**:
- **Grid Dimensions** (Note: size-x, size-y appear in url-parameters-guide.md but are not explicitly used in index.html to define terrain/grid plane size; terrain size is fixed in index.html):
  - While the guide mentions size-x and size-y, the index.html currently uses a fixed SIZE for terrain generation. Pole parameters will work within this fixed terrain.
- **Pole Configuration**:
  - `poles-distances`: Comma-separated list of distances along the Z-axis for poles.
  - `poles-heights`: Comma-separated list of heights for each pole (in feet).
  - `poles-elevations`: Comma-separated list of ground elevations at each pole.

**Important Notes for URL Parameters**:
- All three pole parameters (poles-distances, poles-heights, and poles-elevations) must be provided together and have the same number of values.
- Poles are positioned along the Z-axis.
- The terrain will automatically adjust to create a smooth sloped surface through all pole locations defined by the elevations.
- You can still interact with the simulation (add/remove poles, adjust tension, etc.) after it's initialized with URL parameters.

**Examples**:
- Basic Line Profile with Three Poles: [https://danmaps.github.io/GridScaper/?poles-distances=0,20,40&poles-heights=10,15,12&poles-elevations=0,5,2](https://danmaps.github.io/GridScaper/?poles-distances=0,20,40&poles-heights=10,15,12&poles-elevations=0,5,2)
- Valley Crossing: [https://danmaps.github.io/GridScaper/?poles-distances=0,25,50&poles-heights=20,25,20&poles-elevations=10,0,10](https://danmaps.github.io/GridScaper/?poles-distances=0,25,50&poles-heights=20,25,20&poles-elevations=10,0,10)

## Contexts and Equipment

The simulation includes various settings (contexts) and equipment types that influence the visual appearance of the scene.

### Settings (Contexts)

The primary effect of changing the "Setting" is the type and density of buildings generated.

- **Residential**: Generates a higher number of smaller buildings, suggesting single-family homes. Pole equipment typically defaults to "Distribution."
- **Commercial**: Generates fewer, but larger buildings, suggesting commercial structures.
- **Urban**: Generates more densely packed buildings, some of which can be taller, suggesting an urban core.
- **Rural**: Generates very few buildings, suggesting open or agricultural areas. Birds may be visible on lines.

### Environments

The "Environment" selection changes the terrain color and adds specific environmental props:

- **Coastal**: Features a khaki terrain color, a water body with animated waves and foam, palm trees, a dock, and a basic road. Birds are typically white.
- **Mountain**: Features a dark green terrain color, pine trees, rocks, and a mountain path/road.
- **Desert**: Features a beige terrain color, saguaro cacti, tumbleweeds, and a desert road.
- **City**: Features a lighter green terrain color (suggesting manicured grass), urban-style trees with round canopies, a main road, and cross-streets.

### Equipment

The "Equipment" selection mainly changes the color of the poles and crossarms to visually suggest different types of power lines.

- **Distribution (~4kV–35kV)**: Poles are typically colored brown (suggesting wood).
- **Sub Transmission (~33kV–138kV)**: Poles are typically colored gray (suggesting steel).
- **Bulk Transmission (230kV+)**: Poles are typically colored silver/light gray (suggesting galvanized steel for larger structures). Users can create long spans with noticeable sag.
- **Generation**: Poles are colored gray (steel) with blue accented crossarms. This setting is a visual cue; specific generation facilities like solar panels or wind turbines are not automatically added.
